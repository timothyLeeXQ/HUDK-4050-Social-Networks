# Introduction to Social Network Visualisation with R's igraph package

This repo contains files for an assignment (assignment 2) on social network
analysis in R for HUDK 4050: Core Methods in Educational Data Mining.

HUDK 4050 is the first of three core courses in the Learning Analytics MS at
Teachers College, Columbia University focusing on the thinking, methods, and
conventions in data science. Particular attention is given to the fields of
Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. Refer to the
[Syllabus](https://github.com/timothyLeeXQ/HUDK-4050-Syllabus) (forked from
the [main repo](https://github.com/core-methods-in-edm/syllabus) which may
contain updates for future class iterations) for more information on HUDK 4050.

Other classes in the series are:
* [HUDK 4051: Learning Analytics:
 Process and Theory](https://github.com/timothyLeeXQ/HUDK-4051-Syllabus) ([Main
 repo](https://github.com/la-process-and-theory/syllabus))

## Instructor Notes
### Social Network Analysis

In Assignment 2 we will be looking at some disciplinary data from a middle school. The file "discipline-data.csv" shows which teacher sent which student to the principal during the semester.

We will be using the "igraph" package to visualize the disciplinary relationships between teachers and students as a network. You can read more about igraph here:

http://igraph.org/r/

The instructions to Assignment 2 are in the Assignment 2.rmd file. Assignments are structured in three parts, in the first part you can just follow along with the code, in the second part you will need to apply the code and in the third part is completely freestyle, apply your new knowledge in a new way.

**Please complete as much as you can by 5:00pm, 10/17/19**

Once you have finished, commit, push and pull your assignment back to the main branch.

Good luck!
